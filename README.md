## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

### Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Dataset

Data sources are provided by two public S3 buckets in JSON files

- `Song Dataset` is a subset of real data from the [Million Song](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. Below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

- `Log Dataset` consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. Below is an example of single log data file of 2018-11-12-events.json.

### Data Schema

#### Staging Tables

`staging_events` - records in song dataset
`staging songs` - records in log dataset

#### Fact Table

`songplay` - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- `songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent`

#### Dimension Tables

`users` - users in the app
- `user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level`

`songs` - songs in music database
- `song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration`

`artists` - artists in music database
- `artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude`

`time` - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- `start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday`


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of Python version 3.6 or later
2. AWS Redshift
3. [psycorpg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html)
4. [ipython-sql](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql)


## Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>

Run the following command in the root directory to run the ETL.
1. Creating tables (run this first) :

    `python create_tables.py`
    
2. Run the ETL:

    `python etl.py`

To check the result, open and run cells in `test.ipynb`



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Other than dataset, the main files consist of :
- `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
- `create_tables.py` drops and creates your tables. Run this file to reset tables before each time running ETL scripts.
- `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables.
- `etl.py` reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.
- `sql_queries.py` contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
- `create_cluster.ipynb` a guide notebook to create cluster in Redshift
- `dwh.cfg` configuration about Redshift, IAM and S3
